RPG Chess
Game in Java by Yefim Shneyderman

Uses java.awt and javax.swing as GUI.

RPGChess is a game that I am working on independently to be similar to chess (a beloved classic) that I wanted to make more complex and modern.

The game features 5 selectable classes (caster, ranged, warrior, rogue, and champion) and 15 different playable characters for a player vs. player turn based chess-style rpg game. Players will select which pieces they want to use in the game and play an opponent to level the pieces up and unlock improved stats and abilities. In the game, move your pieces around the board on your turn and attack your opponent's pieces until they have none remaining.

To Do:
	1. Add more types of pieces and design their icons
	2. Design abilities for each piece centered around certain types like ranged, aoe, line, summon, etc.
	3. Make abilities work
	4. Set certain move patterns for each piece - line, jump
	5. Set it so that player must select 1 from each class on the selection screen
	6. Add items to equip to pieces
	7. Add a player figure (selectable)
	8. Add profiles for players
